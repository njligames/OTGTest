# Hello!

## How to test

* Question 1
    * In the terminal run: `bash test.sh`
    * Runs a Test that checks that the numbers 0 to 255 return the name number of 1's for both the iterative and recursive solution.
* Question 2
    * In the terminal run: `bash test.sh`
    * This will run a test that will execute each of the query answers.
* Question 3
    * There is one XCTest written, feel free to give it a try!
* Question 4
    * In the terminal run: `bash test.sh`
    * The test will display the month count based on the contents of data.json

## Info.

* The answer to question 1 is in main.js.
    * I chose to do solve the question with the iterative and recursive approach.
* The answer to question 2 is in Answers.md.
    * In main.py, there is also a function `populateOrdersTable`, which will populate the empty Orders table.

## Thank you!
